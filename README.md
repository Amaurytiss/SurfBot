Surbot is a dialogflow based chatbot which tells you about the surfing conditions of the main spots of Brittany

## Architecture

This chatbot uses the Google Dialogflow platform for the Natural Language Processing tasks, and I built a python server on top on that to answer back to the user forecast informations extracted from the surfline website.

## Why I can't run it ?

To run this bot you will need to build your own DialogFlow architecture on the dialogflow website, it depends on your google account and can't be shared here indeed.
You can still use the api and server example, or ask me anything if you want to build a similar project
